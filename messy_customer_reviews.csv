1,"OMG just ordered from Tony's Pizza Place last night and WOW!!! The margherita pizza was AMAZING - fresh basil, perfect crust, cheese was melted just right. Service was kinda slow though took like 45 mins but worth the wait I guess. Definitely ordering again! Oh and the garlic bread was good too. 4/5 stars would recommend to friends!"
2,"Dragon Wok delivery was terrible!!! Food took 1.5 hours to arrive and when it finally got here the lo mein was cold and soggy :( The kung pao chicken was way too spicy even though I asked for mild. Only good thing was the fried rice which was actually pretty tasty. Won't be ordering again. 2 out of 5 stars. Very disappointed."
3,"BURGER PALACE IS THE BEST!!! Had the bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and a chocolate shake. Burger was juicy and cooked perfectly, fries were crispy, shake was thick and creamy. Staff was super friendly too! Only complaint is it's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Will definitely be back! 5 stars!"
4,"Taco Loco - ordered 6 tacos (2 carnitas, 2 chicken, 2 beef) plus nachos and a burrito. Tacos were authentic and flavorful, meat was tender. Nachos had lots of cheese and toppings. Burrito was HUGE! Delivery guy was nice and food arrived hot. Great value for money. Highly recommend! Rating: 4.5/5"
5,"Sushi Zen... mixed feelings. The salmon roll was incredibly fresh and delicious, rice was perfect temperature. But the California roll was just okay, nothing special. Service was professional but felt rushed. Prices are high but I guess that's expected for quality sushi. Would go back but maybe just for the salmon roll. 3.5 stars"
6,"Green Garden Cafe is a hidden gem!!! As a vegan I'm always looking for good plant-based options and this place delivers! Had the quinoa bowl with extra avocado and it was packed with flavor and super filling. The kale salad was fresh and the dressing was amazing. Staff was knowledgeable about ingredients. 5 stars will be back!"
7,"BBQ Smokehouse... the brisket was dry and overcooked :( Ribs were better but still not great. Mac and cheese was good though! Coleslaw was fresh. Service was friendly but food quality needs improvement. For the price I expected much better. Maybe just had a bad day? 2.5 stars might give another chance"
8,"Pho Saigon is my go-to Vietnamese spot! The pho tai broth is rich and flavorful, noodles are always perfect, meat is tender. Banh mi sandwiches are authentic with crispy bread and fresh ingredients. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous. Family-owned and you can tell they care about quality. 5 stars!"
9,"Mama Mia Italian... the spaghetti carbonara was good but not great. Sauce was a bit too heavy for my taste. Chicken parmigiana was better - crispy coating and good portion size. Caesar salad was fresh. Tiramisu was the highlight - absolutely delicious! Service was attentive. Overall decent experience. 3.5/5 stars"
10,"Fish & Chips Express - got the fish and chips combo with clam chowder. Fish was fresh and flaky, batter was crispy not greasy. Chips (fries) were perfectly cooked. Chowder was creamy and had lots of clams. Great value and fast service. Perfect for a quick lunch by the water. 4 stars!"
